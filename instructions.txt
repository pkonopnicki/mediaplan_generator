Media Plan placement names generator.

- script that generates all combinations of given column values
- it's possible to choose different values per vendor
- it's possible to add/delete columns
- input at least one value per column in each vendor! (no vendor should have a completely empty column)
- in dictionary you can add/edit Buy Model and Buy Rates for each vendor
- in dictionary you can add/remove Start Date and End Date (one or both can be left blank if needed)

To run the script:
- copy entire folder with the script to your desktop
- change 'input.xslx' file to your liking (add/remove combinations). Example with explanation in 'input_example.xlsx'
- open Windows PowerShell (Start -> type 'powershell' -> click on Windows PowerShell to open)
- type 'cd "<script directory>" -> Enter (example: cd "C:\Users\pkonopnicki\Desktop\Mediaplan Python"). Now you're in that folder!
- type 'python main.py' to run the script
- enjoy and relax while the labor is being done by a computer script - output.xslx has been generated in the same folder. This is what you need.
